# pydantic-settings

pydantic-settings lets you define application settings as Pydantic models, automatically loading
values from environment variables, .env files, or other sources.

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    url: str
```

We *can* use this like a normal Pydantic model:

```python
>>> Settings(url="https://www.google.com")
```

But if we set the environment variable `URL` before running the Python interpreter, that value will
be parsed automatically:

```
$ URL=https://www.google.com/ python
Python 3.13.6 (main, Aug  6 2025, 13:05:20) [Clang 17.0.0 (clang-1700.0.13.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
>>> class Settings(BaseSettings):
...     url: str
...     
>>> Settings()
Settings(url='https://www.google.com/')
```

For persistent system settings, we might want to set environment variables somewhere like `.bashrc`
or `.zshrc`, and they will be loaded automatically (as long as the shell is reloaded after updating
these files).

Another approach is to set environment variables in a `.env` file:

```
URL=https://www.google.com/
```

With this file saved as `.env`, settings can be loaded from here if we configure the `Settings`
class:

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    url: str
```
