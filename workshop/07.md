# Serialization

Sometimes we need to convert Pydantic models into a more portable format, for saving to a file or
sending between parts of a system. We might want to just convert it to a Python dict or into JSON.
We can do this easily with Pydantic, but there are a few things we need to watch out for.

Say we have a Pydantic model for `Book` and create an instance of it:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Book(BaseModel):
    title: str
    author: str
    pages: int
    price: float

book = Book(
    title="Clean Code",
    author="Robert C. Martin",
    pages=464,
    price="29.99",
)
```

We can access a Python dict version of this data with `model_dump()`

```
>>> book.model_dump()
{'title': 'Clean Code',
 'author': 'Robert C. Martin',
 'pages': 464,
 'price': 29.99}
```

If we want this in JSON we can use `model_dump_json()`:

```
'{"title":"Clean Code","author":"Robert C. Martin","pages":464,"price":29.99}'
```
