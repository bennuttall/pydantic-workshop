## Pydantic workshop

## What is Pydantic?

- Pydantic is a Python library for data validation and settings management
- It uses Python type hints to define data models
- Pydantic makes working with structured, validated data in Python simple, safe, and efficient

## What can we use it for?

- Data modelling
- Data validation
- Schema definitions
- Consuming web APIs
- Serving web APIs
- Settings & configuration management

## Workshop prerequisites

- You have installed Python
- Have a suitable IDE (e.g. vscode)
  - an IDE which shows inferred types on hover and has autocomplete for inferred types would be most
    useful
- You can run a Python program in the terminal or your IDE
- You have a mechanism for creating virtual environments - and knowing how to activate and connect
  with your IDE
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` at the root of the repo, otherwise install requirements as
  needed - starting with `pydantic`

## vscode

This repo includes vscode settings for automatically formatting your code with Black. This is a
personal preference so you may wish to enable it (ensure you have the relevant extensions
installed), disable it, or change the settings in [.vscode/settings.json](../.vscode/settings.json).

## Pydantic V1 vs V2

This workshop is strictly based on Pydantic V2.

If you previously learned Pydantic V2, there are a few differences but it's easy to learn V2 and
fairly easy to migrate. See the migration guide:
[https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/)

Please be aware that due to the nature of ChatGPT training, it may provide responses with Pydantic
V1 syntax, so it's usually a good idea to specify Pydantic V2 when asking for code snippets.
